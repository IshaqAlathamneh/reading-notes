## Responsive Web Design
#### Responsive Overview
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

#### Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
For some the term responsive may not be new, and others might be even more acquainted with the terms adaptive or mobile. Which may leave you wondering what exactly is the difference between all of them.
Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites. Which term is used specifically doesn’t make a huge difference.

#### Flexible Layouts
Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

#### Media Queries
Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. Being able to apply uniquely targeted styles opens up a world of opportunity and leverage to responsive web design.

***Aspect Ratio Media Features***

The aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio features specifies the width/height pixel ratio of the targeted rendering area or output device. The min and max prefixes are available to use with the different aspect ratio features, identifying a ratio above or below that of which is stated.

#### Mobile First
One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

#### Viewport
Mobile devices generally do a pretty decent job of displaying websites these days. Sometimes they could use a little assistance though, particularly around identifying the viewport size, scale, and resolution of a website. To remedy this, Apple invented the viewport meta tag.

#### Flexible Media
The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes

#### What is “Float”?
Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”. Here is an example of that.

#### What are floats used for?
Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

#### Clearing the Float
Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Again an illustration probably does more good than words do.

#### The Great Collapse
One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their “parent” element)

#### Alternatives
If you need text wrapping around images, there really aren’t any alternatives for float. Speaking of which, check out this rather clever technique for wrapping text around irregular shapes. But for page layout, there definitely are choices.
