    * Make a request to the access token endpoint
    * Receive access token

    Giving access to data if the client is an admin or user or he don'n has account yet
1. What can you do with an access token?

1. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

    It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities.
