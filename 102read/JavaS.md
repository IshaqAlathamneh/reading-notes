# JavaScript
### Indroduction
JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewd in the browser.
1. ACCESS CONTENT

You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page.
1. MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them.
1. PROGRAM RULES 
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page.
1. REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred.

### EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER
1. SLIDESHOWS
Slideshows can display a number of different images within the same space on a given page.
1. FORMS
Validating forms is important when information is supplied by users JavaScript lets you alert the user if mistakes have been made.
1. RELOAD PART OF PAGE
1. FILTERING DATA 

### BROWSER SUPPORT
Each version of a web browser adds new features. Often these new features make tasks easier, or are considered better, than using older techniques. But, website visitors do not always keep up with the latest browser releases, so website developers cannot always rely upon the latest technologies.
## The ABC of programming
1. **A**: What is a script and how do I create one?
1. **B**: How do computers fit in with the world around them?
1. **C**: How do I write a script for a web page?

### A
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
WRITING A SCRIPT:  
   * DEFINE THE GOAL
   * DESIGN THE SCRIPT
   * CODE EACH STEP
Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the:
* Vocabulary: The words that computers understand
* Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow
*** You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them. ***
*** To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help). *** 
## EXPRESSIONS
There are two types of expressions:
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
## OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
1. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
1. STRING OPERATORS
1. COMPARISON OPERATORS
1. LOGICAL OPERATORS
### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

### STRING OPERATOR
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 
*** concatenation: *** the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string
