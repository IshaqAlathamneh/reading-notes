## Links
* Writing Links: Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs
* You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to

## Layout

* Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
*Building Blocks*: CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
*Containing Elements*: If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
* Controlling the Position of Elements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

***Screen Sizes***
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
***Screen Resolution***
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
***Page Sizes***
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.
***Fixed Width Layouts***
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.
***Liquid Layouts***
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
## Functions

* Declaring a function: We declare the functions like this `function sayHello(){code here}`
* Calling a function: We can call the function by write its name for example: `sayHello()`
* Functions need information: `function getArea(x,y)`
* Calling functions that need informations: `getArea(3,4)`
