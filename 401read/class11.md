## Questions
1. Why is access control important?

    Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach.
    
1. Describe an application that would need access control.

    Login credentials (such as usernames and passwords). PINs and one-time passwords (OTPs). Virtual private network (VPN) access to internal networks.
1. What is a role used for?

    Denied anyone to see data he didn't need it, that will make the app more secure.
1. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

    Scalable authorization in role-based access control using negative permissions and remote authorization
