## Questions
1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

    * Better program design and higher code quality
    * Detailed project documentation 
    * TDD reduces the time required for project development
1. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

    If you want to removes the explicit calls from the tests or invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.
1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

    Tests help to seek out bugs, but they can not find bugs that you simply introduce within the test code and in implementation code. If you haven’t understood the matter you would like to unravel, writing tests most likely doesn’t help.
1. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
     The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.
1. Why REST?
     1. REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
     1. REST Makes your Application More Scalable
     1. Caching is Easier with REST
     1. REST is Flexibile
