# Some JavaScript statements or operators
* ## Comparision operators: 
1. "==": this operator compare if the values are same each other (regarding data type).
1. "!=": this operator compare if the values aren't same each other (regarding data type).
1. "===": (strict equal to) this operator compare if the values and the data types are the same.
1. "!==": (strict equal to) this operator compare if the values and the data types aren't the same.

1. ">=": this operator check if the first value is greater than or equal the second value.
1. "<=": this operator check if the first value is less than or equal the second value.

* ## Logical operators 
Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparision operators.
1. "&&": Do expression 1 and expression 2 both evaluate to true?
1. "||": Do expression 1 or expression 2 both evaluate to true?
1. "!": this operator takes a single boolean valu and inverts it.

* ## Loops  
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code will run again. It repeat untill the condition returns false.
1. "For": if you need to run code a specific number of times, use for loop.
1. "While": if you don't know how many times code will run, you can use while.
1. "Do while": It like while statement but it always run the code at least once even if the condition evaluates to false.
