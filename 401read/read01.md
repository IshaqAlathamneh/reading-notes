### Value of the Time
“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” `-Niklas Göke`

The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.
 * They spend hours watching low-quality television and social media when they should be productive and effective.
 * They say yes to things they have no business doing. They give away their talents, attention, and effort to others who take, take, take.

***But what if you placed a high value on your time?***

Imagine that an hour of your time is worth $1,000. Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

***“Busyness” Isn’t a Badge of Honor; It’s a Sign of Weakness*** “Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” `-Tim Ferriss`

***“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”*** 
Always ask your self this question `Who’s in charge of your time? You? Or everyone else?`.

***Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy***
“People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” `-William Irvine`
“Being busy is a form of mental laziness.” `-Tim Ferriss`

***“Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”***

***“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” `-Warren Buffet`***
You probably need to say “no” more.
Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.
Those few things determine their career, legacy, and livelihood.

***In Conclusion***
“Living in frenzy is a sign we’ve squandered too much.” `-Niklas Goke`

### problem solving
“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” `— Steve Jobs`

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems
1. Try a solution.
1. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
1. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.

The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
1. Understand 
  Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them
  How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.
  “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” `— Richard Feynman`
1. Plan
  Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.
  In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
1. Divide
  Pay attention. This is the most important step of all. Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer. Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!. This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. ***If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’***
1. Stuck?
  what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem? In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:
  * Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging
  * Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
  * Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem!

#### Practice
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with `<insert concept here>`.”
In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.

### 5 Whys Technique
when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

***When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis?*** You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems

***How to Use the 5 Whys***
1. Assemble a Team
1. Define the Problem
1. Ask the First "Why?"
1. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
1. Know When to Stop
1. Address the Root Cause(s)
1. Monitor Your Measures
