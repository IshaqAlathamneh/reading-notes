1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
    The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control.

    When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
